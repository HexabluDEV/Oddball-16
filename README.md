# About
a silly and whimsical 16x16 tileset, I created this tileset completely from scratch to practice pixelart with a 7-color greyscale ramp.

the font is modeled off of my handwriting, *yeah its lovely i know* 😔

Also, at the time of creating this, I haven't really figured out how to play the game fully, I thought it might bring an interesting perspective on the artstyle, so maybe there will be some things here that havent been done before!
