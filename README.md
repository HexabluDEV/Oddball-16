# About
a silly and whimsical 16x16 tileset, I created this tileset completely from scratch to practice pixelart with a 7-color greyscale ramp.

the font is modeled off of my handwriting, *yeah its lovely i know* ðŸ˜”

I always wanted to figure out how to play that dwarf fortress game, and I also always wanted to make a rougelike tileset ...The rest is history!

A couple of the sprites are repurposed from my game "Fatem.019"
